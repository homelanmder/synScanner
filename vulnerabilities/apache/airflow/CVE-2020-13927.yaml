id: CVE-2020-13927

info:
  name: Airflow Experimental <1.10.11 - REST API 认证绕过
  author: wintry
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Airflow's Experimental API <1.10.11 allows all API requests without authentication.
  remediation: |
    From Airflow 1.10.11 forward, the default has been changed to deny all requests by default.  Note - this change fixes it for new installs but existing users need to change their config to default `[api]auth_backend = airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all` as mentioned in the Updating Guide linked in the references.
