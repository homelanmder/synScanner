info:
  name: Spring Security OAuth2 - 远程命令执行(CVE-2016-4977)
  author: wintry
  severity: high
  description: Spring Security OAuth versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.9 and 1.0.0 to 1.0.5 contain a remote command execution vulnerability. When processing authorization requests using the whitelabel views, the response_type parameter value was executed as Spring SpEL which enabled a malicious user to trigger remote command execution via the crafting of the value for response_type.
  remediation: Users of 1.0.x should not use whitelabel views for approval and error pages. Users of 2.0.x should either not use whitelabel views for approval and error pages or upgrade to 2.0.10 or later.
